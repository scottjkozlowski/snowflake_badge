--staging data
-- Internal stage
-- Stores data files internally within Snowflake. For more details, see Choosing an internal stage for local files.

-- External stage
-- References data files stored in a location outside of Snowflake. Currently, the following cloud storage services are supported:

-- Amazon S3 buckets

-- Google Cloud Storage buckets

-- Microsoft Azure containers

-- The storage location can be either private/protected or public.

-- You cannot access data held in archival cloud storage classes that requires restoration before
-- it can be retrieved. These archival storage classes include, for example, the Amazon S3 Glacier
-- Flexible Retrieval or Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or Microsoft Azure Archive Storage.
