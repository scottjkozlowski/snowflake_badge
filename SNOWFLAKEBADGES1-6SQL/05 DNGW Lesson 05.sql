----NOTES
----In computer science, idempotency means an operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial execution. Essentially, it's like pressing a button that performs a specific action; pressing it once or multiple times achieves the same initial outcome. This is crucial in distributed systems and API design to ensure reliability and prevent unintended side effects.
